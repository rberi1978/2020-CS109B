You should read the Keras [guidelines](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/custom_layers_and_models) on how to build custom layers. You are required to fill the specific methods indicated below on each part.\n",

    "**2.1** Setup a custom layer consisting of convolutional layers and complete the `__init__` and `call` methods of the `ConvEncoder` class.

The intention is to halve the spatial dimensions on each convolutional layer while augmenting the number of channels on deeper layers.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will code a standard Variational Autoencoder. You will first create a custom layer `Sampling` that takes the mean and log-variance of a Gaussian distribution as inputs, and returns a sample from that distribution. You will use this sample as a latent representation of your probabilistic encoder conditioned on the input image, and use it to reconstruct an image. You will build the complete VAE architecture and study its properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to minimize the negative ELBO function formed by a reconstruction loss and a regularization term over the mean and variance of the probabilistic encoder. You will train two VAE models, one with no regularization, and a second with regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.1** Complete the `call` function of Sampling keras layer. This function takes as input the mean and log-variance vectors of a multivariate Gaussian distribution and returns a sampled tensor from this distribution.\n",

    "- Dense layer with ReLu activation.\n",
    "- Reshape layer: reshapes the output of dense into `latent_dim`.\n",
    "- ConvDecoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, `VAE1` should not use any regularization of the probabilistic encoder (from the prior). \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, `VAE2` should incorporate a KL loss to regularize the probabilistic encoder to normal Gaussian of zero mean and unit variance acting as prior, as explained in class. \n",
    "You may use the following expression: `kl_loss = - reg * 0.5 * tf.reduce_mean(z_log_var - tf.square(z_mean) - tf.exp(z_log_var) + 1)`, where a reasonable value for `reg = 0.1` (feel free to adjust).\n",
    "To include the intermediate loss in `VAE2`, you may use the function `add_loss` from keras models/layers as explained in the [documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/train_and_evaluate). \n",

    "**We recommend saving your trained models.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.3** Why do we use linear activation values to encode the mean and log-variance of the probabilistic encoder? Explain your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.4** Visualize 1 original image and 5 reconstructed images from the validation data fed to `VAE1` and `VAE2`. Comment on the reconstructed images. Notice that you may need to tune penalty regularization term to observe differences between `VAE1` and `VAE2` (there should be differences!).\n",

    "Conditional VAEs are similar to standard VAEs were you incorporate an input's label/information into the latent space. When the model is trained in this form, the model learns to distinguish between these features. For example, you can select features on latent space manually, and explore the space of representations in an explicit manner. We point you to [one](https://wiseodd.github.io/techblog/2016/12/17/conditional-vae/) and [two](https://ijdykeman.github.io/ml/2016/12/21/cvae.html) short tutorials on conditional VAEs. Additionally, you may be interested in reading the [original paper](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5775-learning-structured-output-representation-using-deep-conditional-generative-models.pdf), or a [continuation paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7880-learning-latent-subspaces-in-variational-autoencoders.pdf). \n",

    "In this exercise you are going to build a conditional VAE, and reconstruct images by altering their attributes. For example, pick a set of 'not smiling men' and transform them by changing the label conditions such as 'smile' or 'gender' in latent space. You can choose whatever attributes you want, as long as the reconstructed latent space shows reasonable success when changing the attribute labels.\n",

Datasets are `iterable`, so you can use them directly in a for loop to obtain mini-batches. You need to run these three steps inside the for loop: \n",

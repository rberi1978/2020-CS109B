What we have learnt during our study of the dataset is that we need to understand and characterize 3 different aspects. 

1. The galaxy itself, independent of an observer. Sersic index, flux, shear are some of its parameters.
2. The observation instrument characteristics (telescope). Point spread function (PSF) is used for this.
3. The environment noise, which could be the atmospheric noise, CCD detector noise etc.

These are independent of each other, however, the final image that we have is affected by each of these. We would need to train a network to be able to “de-convolve” these aspects, and predict one or more of these parameters.
